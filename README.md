# Fraud Detection in Electricity and Gas Distribution

## Introduction

Fraud in electricity and gas distribution is a significant challenge for utilities and energy providers worldwide. Fraudulent activities such as meter tampering, illegal connections, and energy theft lead to substantial financial losses and compromise the efficiency of energy distribution networks. 

This project leverages **data analytics** and **machine learning techniques** to detect and mitigate fraudulent activities in electricity and gas distribution systems, ensuring reliability and efficiency in energy distribution networks.

## Common Types of Fraud

1. **Meter Tampering**: Altering meters to under-record consumption.
2. **Illegal Connections**: Unauthorized connections to energy grids.
3. **Billing Fraud**: Manipulating billing systems to reduce payable amounts.
4. **Energy Theft**: Tapping directly into energy lines to bypass metering systems.
5. **Identity Fraud**: Using false information to create accounts or avoid detection.

## Steps Performed

### **1. Data Exploration and Understanding**
- **Datasets Used**:
  - **Invoice Train Table**: Transactional data on electricity and gas consumption.
  - **Client Train Table**: Client demographic and categorical information.
- Observations:
  - Invoice data size: 4.4M rows, 16 columns.
  - Client data size: 135K rows, 6 columns.
  - One-to-Many relationship between clients and invoices.

### **2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Merged datasets using `client_id` key.
- Standardized date formats for consistency.
- Handled missing values (no significant missing data was found).

### **3. Feature Engineering**
Key features created include:
- **Total Consumption**: Sum of consumption levels for each client.
- **Invoice Gap**: Time difference between invoices.
- **Client Age**: Lifetime of the client in the system.
- **Fraud Risk Flag**: High-risk clients flagged based on fraud rates.

### **4. Insights and Visualizations**
- **Proportional Split**: Electricity (68.8%) vs. Gas (31.2%).
- **Trends Over Time**: Peak client adoption for electricity (2007) and gas (2008) followed by declines post-2010.
- **Regional Distribution**: Region 101 has the highest client density (~1.07M clients).

## Insights from Analysis

1. **Energy Split**:
   - Electricity dominates with ~68.8%, while gas accounts for ~31.2%.
   - Potential for growth in gas services.

2. **Client Trends**:
   - Peak in electricity and gas adoption occurred in the early 2000s.
   - Declines after 2010 could indicate policy or market changes.

3. **Regional Client Distribution**:
   - Region 101 is the most densely populated with clients.
   - Lower-density regions offer opportunities for growth.
