Similar to electricity, a substantial decline followed, with the number falling to **1,381 clients** by 2018.\n\n2. **Significant Growth Periods**:\n   - Both gas and electricity services saw notable growth between **1999 and 2007**, likely due to increased service coverage or adoption rates during that period.\n\n3. **Steep Declines Post-2010**:\n   - A sharp decline in the number of clients for both services was observed after 2010, which may be attributed to changes in market conditions, economic factors, or the emergence of alternative energy sources.\n\n4. **Electricity as a Dominant Service**:\n   - Throughout the analyzed years, electricity consistently maintained a significantly larger client base compared to gas, emphasizing its critical role in the energy sector.\n\n5. **Transition in Recent Years**:\n   - The decline in client numbers for both services became more pronounced after 2016, signaling potential market saturation, changes in energy policies.\n\n#### Implications\nThis analysis provides a historical perspective on client adoption for gas and electricity services, which is crucial for identifying growth opportunities, planning service improvements, and strategizing for market expansion.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get region-wise client count\nregion_client_count = df['region'].value_counts().sort_values(ascending=False)\n\n# Plot region-wise number of clients\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nsns.barplot(x=region_client_count.index, y=region_client_count.values, palette=\"viridis\",order=region_client_count.index)\n\n# Set Y-axis ticks to the nearest 100,000\nstep_size = 100000  \nmax_count = region_client_count.max()\nplt.yticks(range(0, max_count + step_size, step_size))\n\n# Format Y-axis labels as integers with commas\nplt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, _: f'{int(x):,}'))\n\n# Data labels on each bar\nfor i, value in enumerate(region_client_count.values):\n    plt.text(i, value + 1, str(value), ha='center', fontsize=10, rotation = 60)\n\nplt.title('Region-Wise Number of Clients', fontsize=16)\nplt.xlabel('Region', fontsize=14)\nplt.ylabel('Number of Clients', fontsize=14)\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-19T01:01:31.053572Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-19T01:01:31.054638Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-19T01:01:31.676906Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-19T01:01:31.054597Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-19T01:01:31.675817Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Regional Distribution of Clients\n\n#### Overview\nThis bar chart highlights the distribution of clients across various regions, providing insights into regional energy usage and client density.

Key insights include:\n\n- **Fraudulent Client**: \n  - Displays a **zigzag pattern** in monthly consumption, deviating significantly from the average consumption.\n  - The erratic pattern indicates inconsistent behavior, characteristic of fraudulent activity.\n\n- **Overall Trend**: \n  - The distinct behavior of fraudulent clients compared to honest ones can be observed across multiple examples, validating this pattern as a recurring phenomenon.\n  - This type of analysis is highly useful for identifying and investigating suspected customers based on irregular consumption behavior.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Future Scope of the Project\n\nAs part of the current project, we carried out data understanding, cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an imbalanced dataset. Furthermore, several enhancements need to be done to improve the outcomes and insights derived from the data:\n\n **Model Development and Evaluation**:\n   - Develop machine learning models to predict fraudulent activities.\n   - Address the data imbalance using techniques like oversampling (SMOTE), undersampling, or cost-sensitive algorithms.\n   - Evaluate models with appropriate metrics like F1-score, precision-recall curves, and AUC-ROC to handle the imbalance effectively.\n**Advanced Feature Engineering**:\n   - Create new features, such as seasonality-based consumption patterns or rolling averages, to capture behavioral insights.\n   - Perform feature selection to identify the most influential predictors for fraud detection.\n\n **Time-Series Analysis**:\n\n **Real-Time Fraud Detection System**:\n   - Implement a real-time monitoring system that flags unusual consumption patterns indicative of fraud.\n   - Integrate the system with dashboards for immediate action by stakeholders.\n\n **Customer Segmentation**:\n   - Cluster customers based on consumption behavior to identify groups more prone to fraudulent activities.\n   - Design targeted interventions or personalized services for different customer segments.\n\n **Enhanced Data Collection**:\n   - Incorporate additional data points such as customer demographics, weather conditions, and billing history.\n   - Explore IoT integration for more granular and real-time data collection.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the project can evolve into a comprehensive system for fraud detection, customer behavior analysis, and energy consumption optimization, ultimately delivering greater value to stakeholders.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
